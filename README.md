## About This Repo
This repository is basically a resource for those looking for a good Minecraft anti-cheat software. It covers most of the best anticheats, along with statistics to prove which is (most likely) the BEST.

## What is the Best Minecraft Anti-Cheat?
There are many different types of Minecraft anti-cheat software to choose from, and lots og different opinions on which one is the best.

This section goes over some data I've collected to determine which one is statistically the best anti-cheat.

### What data are we going to use?
To find the best anti-cheat, we will use the following:

- Price (Measued in United States Dollars / USD)

- Performance (Asynchronous? Multithreaded?)

- Bypasses (What bypasses?)

- False Positives

- Detections

- Unique Features

We will include private anti-cheats in the mix.

### Anti-Cheats
For our data, we will focus on the following anti-cheat plugins (assuming the latest version):

- Polar

- Intave (14.x.x)

- AntiGamingChair

- Grim

- Watchdog (Simulation and Non-Simulation versions)

- Matrix

- Vulcan

Now, let's actually look at the anticheats that were listed above in detail.

1. Polar (Paid, Public?)
